You have been brought into a scenario where our entire DevOps team just vanished over night. ~~We suspect it could be an alien abduction, since some of our engineers brought up UFO sightings in the stand-ups last week~~ (_Needs peer review_).

### About our Application

We are planning for the big release of our **Hello World Application** by end of the day

Our DevOps team was working day and night to get this application onto the CICD pipeline but, unfortunately they couldnt complete it, which is where you come in!

The Application code can be found under: 
https://github.com/DevOpsTestLab/sample-spring-boot

_Fork it under your personal GITHUB account to starting making modifications_




### About our Customer
This application will be targetted to our customers all around the globe who desperately need to be greeted with a **Hello**, specially during these tough times!
